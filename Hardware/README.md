This is the Files for the PCB for the GPIO Hat
==============================================

This version of the design was done using EasyEDA

This was my first PCB design, so probably lots of things wrong.

The bottom layer is a large ground plane with a couple of traces where these couldn't (easily) be routed on the top.
